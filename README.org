* Unix filedescriptor related utilties

** ~mod fd~

Provides basic functions around unix filedescriptors.  Especially, it
implements wrappers around ~openat()~ and related ~*at()~ syscalls.

** ~mod dir~

Implements ~fdopendir()~ and directory traversal functions for Unix
filedescriptors.

** ~mod chroot~

Implements functions to access a directory in a chroot like way
without requiring superuser permissions.  E.g. it will resolve
symlinks relative to the chroot top directory.  Every traversal and
lookup operation will be done in a secure (non-racy) way by using
~openat()~ and related functions.
